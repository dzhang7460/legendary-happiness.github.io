                    Closest to the Sun are the <strong>terrestrial planets</strong> — small, rocky worlds with solid surfaces and dense cores. These inner planets formed from metal-rich materials that could withstand the Sun’s early heat. Their proximity to the Sun means they have shorter orbits and warmer climates, though these vary dramatically from one world to the next.

                <h4>Mercury</h4>
                <p>
                    Mercury is the smallest planet and orbits closest to the Sun. It’s a world of extremes: scorching hot during the day and freezing cold at night because it has almost no atmosphere to retain heat. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon. Despite its small size, Mercury has a surprisingly large metallic core, giving it a strong magnetic field.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h4>Venus</h4>
                <p>
                    Venus is nearly the same size as Earth but couldn’t be more different. Wrapped in thick clouds of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, it has a runaway greenhouse effect that traps heat and pushes surface temperatures above <span class="highlight">460°C</span> — hotter than Mercury, even though it’s farther from the Sun. Volcanoes, plains, and mountains lie hidden beneath its dense atmosphere, and it rotates very slowly — and backwards — compared to most planets.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h4>Earth</h4>
                <p>
                    Earth is our home and the only known planet with liquid water on its surface and life. Its protective atmosphere contains oxygen and nitrogen, and its magnetic field shields it from harmful solar radiation. Earth’s climate and geological activity create diverse environments — oceans, continents, mountains, and deserts — that have evolved over billions of years. The Moon, Earth’s natural satellite, stabilizes its tilt and causes tides.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h4>Mars</h4>
                <p>
                    Mars, the “Red Planet,” is a cold desert world covered in iron-rich dust. It has the tallest volcano in the Solar System (Olympus Mons) and enormous canyons that hint at a watery past. Scientists believe Mars once had rivers, lakes, and perhaps even oceans. Today, polar ice caps, traces of ancient riverbeds, and underground ice suggest water still plays a role in its geology.
