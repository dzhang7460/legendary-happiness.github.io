            <h2>Timeline of Space Exploration</h2>
            <p>
                Humanity's journey into space is a story of ambition, innovation, and discovery. From the first satellite to the advanced rovers exploring other worlds, each milestone has expanded our understanding of the universe. Below is a timeline of some of the most significant events in space exploration.
            </p>

            <ul class="timeline">
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1957</span> – Sputnik 1</h4>
                    <p>Launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. It was the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth and officially started the “Space Age” and the space race.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1961</span> – Yuri Gagarin</h4>
                    <p>Aboard the Soviet Vostok 1, Gagarin became the first human in space on April 12, 1961, completing one orbit of Earth in 108 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1969</span> – Apollo 11</h4>
                    <p>Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon. Armstrong's famous quote: <span>“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”</span></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1971</span> – Mars 3</h4>
                    <p>The first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing on Mars, launched by the Soviet Union. The signal unfortunately lasted only 20 seconds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1977</span> – Voyager 1 and 2</h4>
                    <p>Launched to explore the outer planets. Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space in <span class="highlight">2012</span> and carries the Golden Record, a message for potential extraterrestrial life.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1981</span> – Space Shuttle Program</h4>
                    <p>NASA launched Columbia, beginning the era of reusable shuttles. This program enabled satellite deployment, space station assembly, and numerous scientific missions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">1990</span> – Hubble Space Telescope</h4>
                    <p>Deployed into orbit, revolutionizing astronomy with its incredible deep-space imagery and observations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">2000</span> – International Space Station (ISS)</h4>
                    <p>Assembly began on what would become the largest human-made object in space, supporting a continuous human presence in low Earth orbit since November 2000.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">2012</span> – Curiosity Rover</h4>
                    <p>Part of NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory mission, this rover studies Mars’ climate and geology, searching for evidence of past habitability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><span class="highlight">2020</span> – Perseverance Rover & Ingenuity Helicopter</h4>
                    <p>The Perseverance rover explores Jezero Crater for signs of ancient life, while Ingenuity became the first aircraft to achieve powered, controlled flight on another planet.</p>
