                    Beyond Neptune lies a frozen frontier — the <strong>Kuiper Belt</strong>, a region filled with icy bodies left over from the Solar System’s formation. Here we find <strong>dwarf planets</strong>, objects massive enough for gravity to make them spherical, but not large enough to clear their orbits.

                <h4>Pluto</h4>
                <p>
                    Pluto, once the ninth planet, is the most famous dwarf planet. It has icy mountains, nitrogen plains, and a thin atmosphere that freezes and falls as snow when it drifts farther from the Sun. Its largest moon, <span class="highlight">Charon</span>, is so big that Pluto and Charon actually orbit a point in space between them, almost like a double planet.

                <h4>Other Dwarf Planets</h4>
                <p>
                    Other dwarf planets include <strong>Haumea</strong>, which spins so fast it’s shaped like an oval; <strong>Makemake</strong>, bright and distant; <strong>Eris</strong>, one of the most massive; and <strong>Ceres</strong>, the only dwarf planet located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

                <h4>The Oort Cloud and Comets</h4>
                <p>
                    Beyond the Kuiper Belt may lie the <strong>Oort Cloud</strong> — a distant, spherical region that could contain trillions of icy bodies, extending halfway to the nearest stars. When these icy objects are disturbed, they fall toward the Sun as <strong>comets</strong>, developing bright tails as their frozen gases vaporize.

                <h4>Asteroids and Meteoroids</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Asteroids</strong> are rocky leftovers, mostly found between Mars and Jupiter. Some cross Earth’s path, while others form families that orbit together. Studying them gives scientists clues about how the planets formed.<br>
                    <strong>Meteoroids</strong> are smaller fragments; when they enter Earth’s atmosphere, they become <strong>meteors</strong> — the shooting stars we see streaking across the sky.
