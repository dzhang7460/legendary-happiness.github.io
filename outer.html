                    Beyond Mars lies <strong>the realm of the giants</strong>, planets made not of rock but of gas and ice. These outer planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — formed in the colder regions of the early Solar System, where lighter elements could condense.

                <h4>Jupiter</h4>
                <p>
                    Jupiter, the largest planet, could fit more than <span class="highlight">1,300 Earths</span> inside it. Its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, swirling with colorful clouds and massive storms, including the Great Red Spot — a hurricane larger than our entire planet that has lasted for centuries. Jupiter’s gravity dominates the Solar System, influencing the orbits of asteroids and comets. It has over 90 known moons, including four large ones discovered by Galileo: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Europa, covered in ice, likely hides a liquid ocean beneath its surface — one of the most promising places to search for life.

                <h4>Saturn</h4>
                <p>
                    Saturn is instantly recognizable by its dazzling rings made of ice and rock. Though the rings look solid, they’re made of countless small particles orbiting the planet. Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, is shrouded in a dense orange atmosphere and has rivers and lakes of liquid methane and ethane. Another moon, Enceladus, has icy geysers that shoot water vapor into space — evidence of a hidden ocean beneath its frozen crust.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h4>Uranus and Neptune</h4>
                <p>
                    Uranus and Neptune are known as the ice giants. They contain more water, ammonia, and methane ices than hydrogen and helium. Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side, probably due to a massive ancient collision. Its tilt gives it seasons that last over 20 years each. Neptune, the farthest major planet, is a deep blue world with fierce winds — the fastest in the Solar System — and a dark, swirling storm system. Its moon Triton orbits backward, suggesting it was captured from the outer Kuiper Belt.
